# GhanaValidate

`GhanaValidate` is an independent Digital Ghana public-infrastructure product. Its canonical public home is `https://validate.digitalghana.dev` after production evidence supports a lifecycle transition.

## Before implementation

1. Record the problem, users, non-goals, source rights and acceptance evidence in `agent_plan.md`.
2. Replace the placeholder source-register record only after authority and licence review.
3. Add domain contracts before transport or UI code.
4. Keep deployments fail-closed until required provider values exist.

## Verification

Run `ruby scripts/validate.rb`. Product-specific checks are added to the same quality workflow as implementation lands.
